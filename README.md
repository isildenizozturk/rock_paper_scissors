# Rock Paper Scissors
Java GUI Game

You can find the code in the master branch


I wrote a class to represent the game, used other classes(Computer, Player) that I created and GUI Program to allow players to use the "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors" buttons to choose their choice to play the game against the computer.
